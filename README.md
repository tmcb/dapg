# `dapg`: a dumbass pager

## Usage
```
dapg [files]
```

## Description
A dumbass pager.  Just check the code, it is really dumb.

## Options
Use `less`.

Oh, OK, nevermind.  This program itself has no options.

## Caveats
It is written in Perl.  If you are running it in a potato (or, even
worse, a Windows box), it may not be installed.
